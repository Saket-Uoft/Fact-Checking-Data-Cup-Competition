## Fact-Checking-Data-Cup-Competition
In this project we worked in a team of five people. We have developed three classification models to predict the truth ratings (labels) that human fact checkers would assign to each claim based on some related articles and the metadata. The models include Passive Aggressive algorithm, LSTM and BERT. The comparison for models with different features on the basis of F1-Score and Train, Test Accuracy was done towards the end to select the model with best performance
